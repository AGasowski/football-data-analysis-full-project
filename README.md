# Football Data Analysis – Full Project

This repository contains the full group submission for a data analysis project carried out at ENSAI.  
The goal of the project was to explore various aspects of football data between 2006 and 2016, using match statistics (home/away goals, match outcomes, team performance metrics, etc.) to answer a series of analytical questions.

The final report, written collaboratively by the group, is available in PDF format in the `report/` folder.


## Project Overview

The project addresses a set of **12 analytical questions**, divided among the members of the group.
These questions include:

- identifying dates with the highest number of draws,
- assessing optimal team compositions,
- analysing scoring patterns (home vs. away),
- identifying top-performing teams,
- comparing match results across leagues,
- studying goal distributions,
- investigating anomaly cases,
- clustering teams based on performance metrics,
- **predicting the final league standings based on team performance variables**,  
- and more.

The full set of questions and detailed answers can be found in the final report.


## Data Availability
